        <p>
            I'm currently working at Accenture in a deployment/infrastructure role. I am constantly learning something new everyday and enjoy the challenge of the unknown.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have an interest in cyber security and I believe it is absolutely necessary to know the ins and outs of software development in order to be a successful security professional.
